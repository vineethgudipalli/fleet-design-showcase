# Figma OAuth Configuration (OAuth 2.0 with PKCE)
# Create a new OAuth app at https://www.figma.com/developers/api#authentication
# Get your client ID and secret from your Figma OAuth app settings
VITE_FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=your_figma_client_id_here
VITE_FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_figma_client_secret_here

# Development redirect URI (for local testing)
VITE_FIGMA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/figma/callback

# Production redirect URI (set in GitLab CI/CD Variables)
# VITE_FIGMA_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR-USERNAME.gitlab.io/Fleet Design Showcase/auth/figma/callback

# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING FOR GITLAB PAGES DEPLOYMENT:
# When deploying to GitLab Pages, the client secret will be embedded in the
# JavaScript bundle and visible to anyone who inspects the code. This is a
# known security tradeoff accepted for internal team use.
#
# MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
# - Rotate the client secret regularly (monthly recommended)
# - Monitor your Figma OAuth app usage for suspicious activity
# - Upgrade to a serverless backend when GCP services are available
#   (GCP Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers, etc.)
#
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
# Set these variables in GitLab: Settings → CI/CD → Variables
# - VITE_FIGMA_CLIENT_ID
# - VITE_FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET (mark as "masked")
# - VITE_FIGMA_REDIRECT_URI
